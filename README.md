A concert calendar tracker
a concert tracking app using a Flutter frontend, a Go backend, and a MongoDB database. The app will provide a clean user interface that allows users to discover nearby concerts and manage their live music experiences. Key features will include the ability to create shareable lists of concerts, set up countdown timers and reminders for upcoming shows, and view local events based on their location. This combination of technologies will enable a fast, scalable, and flexible application to meet these user needs.
